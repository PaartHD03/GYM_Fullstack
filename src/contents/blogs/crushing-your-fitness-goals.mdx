## The Foundation: Set Goals Like a Pro  

Before you even lace up your sneakers, ask yourself: *What do I want to achieve?*  
Whether it’s building muscle, torching fat, or boosting endurance, having a clear goal is the first step. Goals give your workouts purpose and keep you accountable when the initial hype fades.  

### Pro Tip:  
Break your goal into smaller milestones. Celebrate every win, whether it’s adding 5 lbs to your bench press or finally mastering that elusive pull-up.
